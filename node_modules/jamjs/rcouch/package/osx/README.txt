rcouchx Preview

In order to run the appliction please drag and drop the "rcouchx" icon
into the "Applications" folder. You can start the rcouchx application
from within the "/Applications" directory.

Notes:

1- Please do make sure you have erased the previous nstallation from
"~/Library/Application Support/rcouchx"

2- The application will not start if you attempt to run the server without
copying to a writeable disk. The dmg file which contains "rcouchx.app"
is a read-only format and the server needs to be deployed on a writable volume.
3- rcouch console is available here: /Applications/rcouch.app/Resources/rcouch/bin/rcouch
